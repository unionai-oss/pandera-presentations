- Expressing schemas as code should feel familiar to Python users, regardless of
  the dataframe library theyâ€™re using.
- Data validation should be compatible with the different
  workflows and tools in in the data science and ML stack
  without a lot of setup or configuration.
- Defining custom validation rules should be easy.
- The validation interface should make the debugging process easier.
- Integration with existing code should be as seamless as possible.
- Extending the interface to other statistical data structures should be easy
  using a core set of building blocks and abstractions.
